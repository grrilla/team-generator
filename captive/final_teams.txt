MANUAL UPDATE:

We do not have enough participants to do all the rooms, so we have to eliminate one. I could have rewritten the script to
accomodate this, but I have enough work things to do. Everyone got their first pick (as you can see form the output), but one
room, Cabinet of Curiosities is supposed to accomodate 4-12 people and they only have three. Therefore, we are manually
redistributing those 3 players to their second choices. Finally, two players RSVP'd without selecting rooms, so they are
manually being placed in rooms to balance the headcount across teams. The final teams for the three rooms (selected by
interest proportionate to capacity) are:

Dracula's Library (2-7 players)
   Yanish Jutton
   Kevin Lim
   Henry Coelho
   Shawna Lehman
   Srikant Nayak
   
Charlotte (2-7 players)
   Kelsey Eaton
   Luke Liu
   Michael Longauer
   Olya Sanakoev
   Greg Yaniw
   
The Surgeon (2-6 players)
   Carlo Ferrer
   John Fernandes
   Kris Tiu
   Jim Chang
   Arvind Natarajand
